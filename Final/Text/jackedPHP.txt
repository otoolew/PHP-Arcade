    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <p>
        JAcked was a prototype game I made for IS1090 Special Topics: Programming. It was deleoped in the Unity 3D Engine. At the time of development I wanted to challenge myself to a game jam. I dedicated the entire weekend with the goal of developing a game from start to finish.

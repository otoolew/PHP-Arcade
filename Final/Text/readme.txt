I decided to create a game website because I love games!
I have already done a more serious inventory management site for another independant study which is the main reason I chose to build this site. I hope to gain employment in the game industy or publish my own game on Steam.

First Service: User Login, Registration and Edit
How it works: A mix of preg_match, comparison checks, and query checks. All PHP, no JS.
If I had more time: 
1. Implement a social site login option 
2. Expand on User Profiles. Add feature to view other user profiles.
3. Implement better security. I am vulnerable to XSS Attacks :(

Second Service: Games and Score boards
The only Javascript I wrote was for the games. Astroids is all my own JS with a mix of code and inspiration from other folks around the web. Astroids I decided to use phaser.js.
phaser.js was excellent. Users can play the games and their score will be tracked in the database. Users can look at their own personal stats by clicking on their user name at the top right navbar. 
After play, the player is displayed their recent games score. Scores are compared to other players and displayed on the main score board.

JAcked is a game I developed with the Unity 3D Engine.
C# is the primary language for scripting in Unity. I love C#. If you know Java, you know C#.
I used a tool kit and art assests from the unity store to help speed my development.

If I had more time:
I would rewrite SpaceInvaders using phaser.js. It was a joy to use.

I would rewrite JAcked. Like most catch all toolkits there is a lot of extra code that is not needed. I already have begun rebuilding the entire game.

I would also like to integrate a database backend in order to save scores for JAcked. I would have had to use JS or C#. 

Third Service
Was inspired by game review pages I had seen on Steam.
Users can submit reviews for JAcked. Since that is the only game I personally designed.

If I had more time:
I would have made the general game review page more generic with options to choose other games I have designed. 
I have designed various table top games for IS 1090 Special Topics: Programming. I did not know how to approach table top game reviews since User would have to make the game first then play.

OVERALL IF I HAD MORE TIME:
I would rewrite the entire project. I feel MUCH more confident coding in PHP. I had no experience with PHP prior to this class. 
A week ago, I thought about rewriting the project using an MVC archtecture. I use MVC when I developed a ASP.NET Core inventory system.
I am very interested in comparing PHP MVC to .Net MVC.
